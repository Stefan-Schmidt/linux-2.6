 * The callculation is following:
 * For a 2450 MHZ radio freq rate is 62,5 ksym/sec. A byte (8 bit) transfered
 * by low 4 bits in first symbol, high 4 bits in next symbol. So, to transmit
 * 1 byte in 2450Mhz freq 2 symbols are needed. Therefore we have 31,25 kbyte/sec
 * rate. 1 symbol transfered in 16*10^(-6) sec, or 16 microseconds.
 * For a 868Mhz and 915Mhz, 1 symbol is equal to 1 byte. So, we have 20kbyte/sec
 * and 40 kbyte/sec respectively. And 5*10^(-5) sec and 2,5*10(-5) sec,
 * or 50 and 25 microseconds respectively for 868Mhz and 915Mhz freq.
