 * struct ieee802154_ops - callbacks from mac802154 to the driver
 *
 * This structure contains various callbacks that the driver may
 * handle or, in some cases, must handle, for example to transmit
 * a frame.
 *
 * @start: Handler that 802.15.4 module calls for device initialisation.
 * 	This function is called before the first interface is attached.
 *
 * @stop: Handler that 802.15.4 module calls for device cleanup
 * 	This function is called after the last interface is removed.
 *
 * @tx: Handler that 802.15.4 module calls for each transmitted frame.
 *      skb cntains the buffer starting from the IEEE 802.15.4 header.
 *      The low-level driver should send the frame based on available
 *      configuration.
 *      This function should return zero or negative errno.
 *
 * @ed: Handler that 802.15.4 module calls for Energy Detection.
 *      This function should place the value for detected energy
 *      (usually device-dependant) in the level pointer and return
 *      either zero or negative errno.
 *
 * @set_channel: Set radio for listening on specific channel.
 *      Set the device for listening on specified channel.
 *      Returns either zero, or negative errno.
