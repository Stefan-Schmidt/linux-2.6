	---help---
	  This option enables the hardware independent IEEE 802.15.4
	  networking stack for SoftMAC devices (the ones implementing
	  only PHY level of IEEE 802.15.4 standard).

	  If you plan to use HardMAC IEEE 802.15.4 devices, you can
          say N here. Alternatievly you can say M to compile it as
	  module.
